			<p>The ZMap Project started at the University of Michigan in 2013, but has since grown into a larger open source community that maintains a collection of tools that support large-scale Internet measurement. The core team can be reached at <a href="mailto:team@zmap.io">team@zmap.io</a>.</p>

			<p class="last">We have published several papers that describe how ZMap tools are architected:</p>

			<h3><a href="https://zmap.io/paper.html">ZMap: Fast Internet-Wide Scanning and its Security Applications</a></h3>
			<p>Zakir Durumeric, Eric Wustrow, and J. Alex Halderman<br/>
			22nd USENIX Security Symposium, August 2013</p>

			<p class="abstract">Internet-wide network scanning has numerous
			security applications, including exposing new vulnerabilities and
			tracking the adoption of defensive mechanisms, but probing the
			entire public address space with existing tools is both difficult
			and slow. We introduce ZMap, a modular, open-source network scanner
			specifically architected to perform Internet-wide scans and capable
			of surveying the entire IPv4 address space in under 45 minutes from
			user space on a single machine, approaching the theoretical maximum
			speed of gigabit Ethernet. We present the scanner architecture,
			experimentally characterize its performance and accuracy, and
			explore the security implications of high speed Internet-scale
			network surveys, both offensive and defensive. We also discuss best
			practices for good Internet citizenship when performing
			Internet-wide surveys, informed by our own experiences conducting a
			long-term research survey over the past year.</p>

			<h3><a href="https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/zmap10gig-woot14.pdf">Zippier ZMap: Internet-Wide Scanning at 10 Gbps</a></h3>
			<p>David Adrian, Zakir Durumeric, Gulshan Singh, and J. Alex Halderman<br/>
			USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies (WOOT), August 2014</p>

			<p class="abstract">We introduce optimizations to the ZMap network
			scanner that achieve a 10-fold increase in maximum scan rate. By
			parallelizing address generation, introducing an improved
			blacklisting algorithm, and using zero-copy NIC access, we drive
			ZMap to nearly the maximum throughput of 10 gigabit Ethernet,
			almost 15 million probes per second.  With these changes, ZMap can
			comprehensively scan for a single TCP port across the entire public
			IPv4 address space in 4.5 minutes given adequate upstream
			bandwidth.  We consider the implications of such rapid scanning for
			both defenders and attackers, and we briefly discuss a range of
			potential applications.</p>


			<h3><a href="https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/censys-ccs15.pdf">A Search Engine Backed by Internet-Wide Scanning</a></h3>
			<p>Zakir Durumeric, David Adrian, Ariana Mirian, Michael Bailey, J. Alex Halderman<br/>
			22nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS'15)</p>

			<p class="abstract">Fast Internet-wide scanning has opened new
			avenues for security research, ranging from uncovering widespread
			vulnerabilities in random number generators to tracking the
			evolving impact of Heartbleed. However, this technique still
			requires significant effort: even simple questions, such as, "What
			models of embedded devices prefer CBC ciphers?", require developing
			an application scanner, manually identifying and tagging devices,
			negotiating with network administrators, and responding to abuse
			complaints. In this paper, we introduce Censys, a public search
			engine and data processing facility backed by data collected from
			ongoing Internet-wide scans. Designed to help researchers answer
			security-related questions, Censys supports full-text searches on
			protocol banners and querying a wide range of derived fields (e.g.,
			443.https.cipher). It can identify specific vulnerable devices and
			networks and generate statistical reports on broad usage patterns
			and trends. Censys returns these results in sub-second time,
			dramatically reducing the effort of understanding the hosts that
			comprise the Internet. We present the search engine architecture
			and experimentally evaluate its performance. We also explore
			Censys's applications and show how recent questions become simple
			to answer.</p>

			<p>Deepak Kumar, Zhengping Wang, Matthew Hyder, Joseph Dickinson, Gabrielle Beck, David Adrian,
			  Joshua Mason, Zakir Durumeric, J. Alex Halderman, Michael Bailey<br/>
			IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy ("Oakland"), May 2018</p>

			<p class="abstract">Over the past 20 years, websites have grown increasingly complex
			and interconnected. In 2016, only a negligible number of sites are
			dependency free, and over 90% of sites rely on external content.
			In this paper, we investigate the current state of web dependencies
			and explore two security challenges associated with the increasing
			reliance on external services: (1) the expanded attack surface associated
			with serving unknown, implicitly trusted third-party content,
			and (2) how the increased set of external dependencies impacts
			HTTPS adoption. We hope that by shedding light on these issues,
			we can encourage developers to consider the security risks associated
			with serving third-party content and prompt service providers
			to more widely deploy HTTPS.</p>
